## Hi thereüëã

I'm Nickolas de Luca Alberton, a software developer and hardware enthusiast. With more than 10 years of experience within the IT world, and more than 20 years passionately involved with anything that has a functional (and sometimes dysfunctional) circuit board, I have the pleasure of working with what I love most... computers!

## Experience üßë‚Äçüíª

I started as a tech support, where I learned how to work with people. However, I yearned for more. So I began studying everything about quality assurance and decided to become a QA Analyst, striving to deliver software with exceptional quality to my clients. Since it is almost impossible for a human to test everything alone, I decided to learn about test automation, honing my skills as a developer and using code to automate those exhaustive tasks. But then it dawned on me, there's nothing to test without someone developing. Acting as a developer, I was able to develop and test simultaneously, becoming the ultimate developer... developing, testing, and ensuring that my users would have the best software possible.

Since then, I've been adventuring in every corner of the IT world, from desktop to mobile. From the backend to the frontend. Developing software with the hardware in mind. A dev's life can be exhaustive, but it can also be very fruitful.
